# Financial Data Analysis with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression and a sequential neural network, to analyze financial data. The goal was to build models capable of predicting financial anomalies in the stock market.

## Key Features
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessed financial data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Used for  regression analysis
- **Sequential Neural Network:** Built a deep learning model for improved accuracy and complex pattern recognition.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision and recall.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for logistic regression and evaluation metrics.
  - `TensorFlow`/`Keras` for building and training the sequential neural network.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/merc-cyy/stock-market-model.git

   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Future Work
- Incorporating additional analyses like feature engineering.
- Exploring other machine learning models like random forests or XGBoost.
- Adding user support using a chatbot to enable interactivity.
